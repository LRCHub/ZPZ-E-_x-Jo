I'm falling down into my shadow
Grasping onto every breath
As I await the Deadly night

So scary, but you can't give into this
Fear of pumpkin carriages
'Cause all the witches see it in your eyes

See you in your dreams, yeah, baby
Your nightmares too, that's where I'll find you

Fairy blue
Oh, this is just for you that I would crush the stars
And put them on display
Black Paper Moon
If you really put your faith in me
When you're lost, here I am
Forever with your soul
Waiting here above you patiently,
Just like the shining moon

A symbol rises to the surface
Of the crimson sweetness that I had submerged it deep within

Your destiny isn't so immutable
Anything that you can dream
Can also be the fate that you will have

Don't try to use deceit on me
I will not break, I won't surrender

Fairy blue
You are my everything
The reason I go on
In this captivity,
Eternally
If you raise your voice and call for me
I will find you, my dear
Wherever you may be
And I will be sure to set you free from this snaring curse

There are times when no one believes in me and
There are times when I feel like I'm degraded
But even in those times your words always echo within my heart
This is my promise

Fairy blue
Oh, this is just for you that I would smash the stars
And use them as a sign
To guide you
And any time that you're lost or afraid,
Or you can't see your dreams,
I want you to look up

Fairy blue
Kimi ga kureta ikiru akashi
Kizuna to iu shinrai
Kimi ha hitori janai
When you're lost, here I am
Forever with your soul

Tadoritsukeru kimi ga shinjiru nara
